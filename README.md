alarmClock
========
# About
My fianc√© wanted an alarm clock that simulated a sunrise before ringing.  Since all the ones you can buy are expensive, dumb, or both, I decided to make one.

# Dependencies
 * [firelizzard's Nokia LCD library](https://github.com/firelizzard18/Arduino-LCD-Screen) installed in the correct place for Arduino libraries

# Hardware
 * 3-color LED strip
 * Resistors and transistors
 * DS1307 Real Time Clock
 * Nokia 5110 84x48 pixel LCD screen
 * Arduino Duemilanove atmega328P
 * 12V power supply
 
See the /hardware folder in this repo for more information. (when I put it there)
